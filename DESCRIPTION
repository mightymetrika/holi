Description: Higher order likelihood inference is a promising approach for
    analyzing small sample size data. The 'holi' package provides web applications
    for higher order likelihood inference. It currently supports linear, logistic,
    and Poisson generalized linear models through the rstar_glm() function, based
    on Pierce and Bellio (2017) <doi:10.1111/insr.12232> and 'likelihoodAsy'.
    The package offers two main features: LA_rstar(), which launches an interactive
    'shiny' application allowing users to fit models with rstar_glm() through their
    web browser, and sim_rstar_glm_pgsql(), which streamlines the process of
    launching a web-based 'shiny' simulation application that saves results to a
    user-created 'PostgreSQL' database.
