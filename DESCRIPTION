Description: Higher order likelihood inference is a promising development for the
    analysis of small sample size data. The holi package provides web applications
    for higher order likelihood inference using select generalized linear models.
    The 'holi' package currently supports linear, logistic, and Poisson models
    through the rstar_glm() function. The rstar_glm() function is based on Pierce
    and Bellio (2017) <doi:10.1111/insr.12232> and it calls the
    likelihoodAsy::rstar() function internally. The LA_rstar() function launches
    an interactive 'shiny' application which allows users to fit rstar_glm()
    models in their web browser. The sim_rstar_glm_pgsql() streamlines the process
    of launching a web-based 'shiny' simulation application which saves results
    to a user created 'PostgreSQL' database.
